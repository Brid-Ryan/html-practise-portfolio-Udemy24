<h1>Br√≠d's Favourite Movies </h1>

<h2>Here are three movies which I really enjoyed and have watched more than once!</h2>

<p>(I had to decide on these quickly and just go with them. There are so many good movies to be watched but I haven't time as I need to learn to code!)</p>

<h3> Fargo</h3>
<p>This movie is quite dark but also very funny, quirky I suppose. I just love the accents!</p>
